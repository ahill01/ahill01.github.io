            <p>Hi! I am! <b>My name is Allison Hill</b> (<em>she/her/hers</em>), and I'm the one who made pretty much everything you see here (minus the music & the playlisting tool, <a href ="https://bndcmpr.co/f65cd3b9

            <h2>Do You Take Submissions?</h2>
            <p><b>Yes, I do!</b> If you've got something great that you want so share, go ahead and send it my way! The only thing I ask is that you <b>please bear in mind I am a one-woman team!</b> As much as I would love to immediately respond to and write about everything piece of art that sparks interest, I do have the same 24 hours in a day as anyone else (most of which are occupied by work and school right now!). That being said, listening to new music brings me a lot of joy! So go ahead and send me an <a href="mailto:amh03160@gmail.com">email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/A_philharmonic8">a twitter DM</a>, or submit through <a href="./submissionPage.html">my nifty submission form</a></p>

            <h2>Why a Blog? Aren't They Going Out of Style?</h2>
            <p>The answer to this one is short. <b>Because it's fun.</b> And this isn't the only blog I've written for, either! You can check out some of my other work with <a href="https://www.thewildhoneypie.com/buzzing-daily">The Wild Honey Pie's Buzzing Daily</a>.</p>

            <h2>Why G.U.S.H.?</h2>
            <p> As a songwriter myself, I love the experience of thoughtfully listening to songs and albums to discover all the delightful little details that make them great. I wanted to create an outlet to shout from the rooftops about all the awesome music I find and fall in love with, so I thought I'd create a little blog dedicated to all the music I can't help but gush about. :)</p>
