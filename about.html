        <p>Hi, my name is Allison (<em>she/her/hers</em>). I like to create things- music, photographs, block prints, you name it I've probably tried it! This little website is the latest of my creative endevors. I wanted to create an outlet to shout from the rooftops about all the awesome music I find and fall in love with. As a songwriter myself, I love the experience of thoughtfully listening to songs and albums to discover all the delightful little details that make them great. I spent a bit of time writing for <a href="https://www.thewildhoneypie.com/buzzing-daily">The Wild Honey Pie's Buzzing Daily blog</a>, where I discovered the tandem joy of creating a little work of writing that celebrates what makes a song truly great. I want to continue exploring that feeling, so I thought I'd create a little blog dedicated to all the music I can't help but gush about. </a></p>
        <p><em>P.S.</em> If you're curious about what kind of music I make, check me out at <a href="https://denimdaisy.bandcamp.com/">denimdaisy.bandcamp.com</a> :)</p>
